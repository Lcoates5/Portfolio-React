            <p>
            Hello! My name is Lauren Coates. My family calls me Den. I am an always learning and aspiring full stack web developer. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript and React on the front end and Node.js, and Express.js, on the back end. I love projects that require attention to detail and organization. I am a mom of three kids and an avid lover of all things beautiful. You can find me painting, swimming, rock climbing, skating (ice and board) and playing with my family. I am currently seeking a position where I can continue to learn and grow as a developer.
